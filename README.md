# THUMoodleWrapper
A Simple Wrapper to open THU moodle links direct in the moodle app
This is a Simple Moodle wrapper for the Moodle of the THU(Technische Hochschule Ulm/University of Applied Science)

I got inspired for this app by the following Project: [TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper](https://github.com/JonasBernard/TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper)
Same as the Orignal Project the GPL-3.0 license applied to my Version.
