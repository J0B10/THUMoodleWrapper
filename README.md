# THUMoodleWrapper

This is a simple moodle wrapper for moodle links of the THU(Technische Hochschule Ulm/University of Applied Science).
So if you have installed the wrapper and the offical moddle app.
So when you click on a moodle-thu.de link the link will be opend by the wrapper which will than open the moodle app instead the browser.

I got inspired for this app by the following Project: [TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper](https://github.com/JonasBernard/TU-Darmstadt-Moodle-Wrapper)
Same as the Orignal Project the GPL-3.0 license applied to my Version.
